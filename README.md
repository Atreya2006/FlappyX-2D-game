# FlappyX 🐦🎮

**FlappyX** is a Python-based 2D side-scrolling arcade game inspired by the classic Flappy Bird. Built using the Pygame library, it features smooth physics, dynamic difficulty modes, sprite-based animation, responsive controls, and an interactive GUI — all running in real-time.

1) You can play the game on any compiler that can run .py files.

2) Simple run the python file, then the home screen of the game will appear.

3) Now choose the difficulty you want to play in by clicking either 1/2/3, higher number indicating greater difficulty.

4) To start the game simply click on your mouse-pad to make the bird jump and move up in air, you need to avoid hitting the ground or the pipes to stay alive.

5) It also keeps track of the high score.
